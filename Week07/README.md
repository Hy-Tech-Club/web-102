Use DOM Manipulation to update the HTML of a webpage. This lesson covers:
- Updating existing HTML elements
- Creating new HTML elements

## Warm Up
>How much HTML do you think professional web developers write?

## Lecture
- Updating existing HTML elements
- Creating new HTML elements

## Follow-Along Activity: Lyrics Builder
Follow the [instructions](LyricsBuilderFollowAlongInstructions.md) to build up to a simple app that adds lines of a song into a container one-by-one. Be sure to ask the students for suggestions about where to go next. There is no need to spend too long on this.

## Formative Assessment: Kahoot
After the students have learned about DOM Manipulation, and completed the follow-along, test their retention with a Kahoot: https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/7bc99cd7-493b-4353-ac53-111b2a0488b3

All of the questions should be answerable using the information in the lectures.

## Individual Exercise: Background Changer
The students should follow the [individual instructions](BackgroundChangerIndividualInstructions.md) to complete the activity.

## Challenges
There are a number of challenges for the students.

### Shopping List Challenge
This [challenge](Challenges/ShoppingListChallenge.md) is copied from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#Active_learning_A_dynamic_shopping_list).

The main challenge here is the "Delete" button for a given shopping list item. To implement that, the students will have to do some research. They will have to:
- Set up the `onclick` binding function in JavaScript for the button they create
- Use `.removeChild` on the list element to remove the whole list item

### Table Data Challenge
Have the students create a table with a few columns. There should then be a few input fields and a button, where the user should be able to add a new row to the table.
