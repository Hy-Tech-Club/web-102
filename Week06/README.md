# Week 6: DOM Manipulation
Make JavaScript more interactive by manipulating HTML and CSS. This lesson covers:

## Instruction
Present the [Dom Manipulation Intro PowerPoint](DomManipulationIntro.pptx) to introduce DOM manipulation.

## Follow-Along
Follow the [MadLibsFollowAlong](MadLibsFollowAlong.md) instructions to complete the basic Mad Libs page as a class.
