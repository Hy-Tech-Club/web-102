# Warm Up - Cotton Candy Inputs
Start by opening up [this Repl](https://repl.it/@JosephMaxwell/CssRefresh#index.html). It contains a simple HTML page that has a header and two input boxes. The goal of this activity is to give one of the boxes a pink background, and the other one an aqua background (two of the main cotton candy colors).

1. Add an `id` attribute to the first `input` element, and set it to `pink`
1. Add an `id` attribute to the _second_ `input` element, and set _it_ to `aqua`
1. Within the `<style></style>` element, create a new _ruleset_ selecting the `pink` input by its `id`
1. Within the `#pink { }` ruleset, use `background: pink;` to set the background color to pink
1. Repeat the steps above for a `#aqua` ruleset

Click the **Run** button, and the two inputs should appear with the proper cotton candy colors!

## Challenge
For an additional challenge, create a third input that should have a `lavender` background color.
