# Individual Exercise - Geometry Calculations
In this exercise, you will need to create a new HTML file from scratch. Then, follow the instructions below to complete the activity. You will be creating a basic Triangle area calculator.

## Background
Read the following article to learn how to calculate the area of a triangle: http://www.softschools.com/math/geometry/topics/area_of_triangles_part_1/

## Part 1 - Setup
1. Create a new HTML file
1. Add the basic tags to your HTML file - `html`, `head`, `script`

## Part 2 - Prompting for numbers
1. Display a message to the user welcoming them to your calculator
1. Ask the user for the length of the base of their triangle in inches
    - Be sure to store their answer in a variable!
1. Ask the user for the height of their triangle in inches
    - Be sure to store their answer in a variable!

## Part 3 - Performing the calculation
1. Currently, the base and height variables are **strings**
    - Can we do numeric arithmetic with strings?
1. Convert the strings into numbers so we can use them in our equation
1. Once we have the numbers for the base and height, we can find our answer!
    - HINT: Figure out how to calculate the area from the article in the Background section above
1. Display a message to the user showing them the answer

## Part 4 - Mini challenge
Instead of showing the user the answer in inches, first convert it to centimeters, and then display it!

## Challenge
Create more HTML pages and JavaScript files for additional math calculations. You can find a list of common formulas here: http://www.mdc.edu/main/images/common_math_formulas_tcm6-33520.pdf. Choose some cool ones, and create calculators for them. If you're feeling ambitious, you can make up some of your own formulas too! Create at least five formula calculators.

Some good formulas to try:
- Volume of a Sphere
- Volume of a Cone
- Distance between two points
- Quadratic formula

Each page should ask the user for input, perform a calculation, and show the answer. For some of the more involved formulas, you may need to use some of the JavaScript math utilities: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp

Finally, create one main HTML page that links to each of your calculators.
