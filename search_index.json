Then, follow the instructions below to build a little text-based JavaScript program. The program will ask the user a number of questions, and then display some information using the answers the user provides.\nPart 1 - Setup\n\nAdd the html tag to your page\nAdd the head tag to your page (child of html)\nAdd the script tag to your page (child of head)\nWithin the script, add a statement that will show a message to the user welcoming them to your website.\n\nnote: a body is not required for this HTML page\nPart 2 - Asking questions\nFor each of the questions below, show a text box to the user allowing them to answer. Store all of the user's answers in their own variables. Make sure you choose good variable names!\n\nWhat is your full name?\nWhat is your favorite color?\nWhat is your favorite movie?\nWhat is the date today?\n\nPart 3 - Displaying answers\nFor each of the answers retrieved in the previous part, show the user a formatted message like \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\". For an added challenge, attempt to display all the information in only one message box. Use \\n to add a new line into the text value.\nChallenges\nFor these challenges, do some research on your own and try to figure out how to solve them. Please feel free to hop around from one challenge to another, they are not listed in order of difficulty. You should also be able to complete all of these challenges without using if statements, switch statements, for loops, or while loops (which are more advanced topics).\nThese may be helpful resources:\n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp\n\nUppercase movie\nNo matter what the user enters, display their favorite movie in all in uppercase letters.\nRemoving whitespace from movie\nRemove all spaces from the beginning and end of the text the user enters for their favorite movie.\nReplacing red\nIf the user enters \"red\" as their favorite color, replace it with \"blue\" instead.\nSeparate First and Last name\nInstead of displaying the user's full name in one line, display their first name and last name separately. For this challenge, assume the user will enter their first name, then a space, then their last name.\nExample\nInstead of displaying \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\", display \"First Name: Charlie\" and \"Last Name: Chaplin\" on separate lines.\nDisplay actual date\nInstead of displaying the date the user enters, display the actual date.\nOK/Cancel\nAfter the last question, display a pop-up box that has both \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" options. The text in the box should say \"Continue?\".\n\nIf the user clicks OK, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: true\"\nIf the user clicks Cancel, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: false\"\n\nRegardless of what the user chooses to do, continue on and display their information.\nHalf-birthday\nAsk the user for their date of birth, then display their half birthday based on what they enter.\n\nAssume the user will enter their information in the form of \"MM/DD\"\nWhen displaying their half birthday, only show the month and day, in the form \"MM/DD\"\nDo not worry about leap years\n\nDays until the New Year\nIn addition to displaying today's date, display the number of days until the New Year. For example, if today were 12/31, it should display \"1\". If today were 3/9, it should display \"298\".\nTemplate literals\n\nResource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\n\nFigure out how to use template literals to display multi-line text and include variable values without using + or \\n!\n"},"Week03/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week03/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 3 - Comments, Data Types, and Math","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Comments, Data Types, and Math\nReference\n\nMore Concepts PowerPoint Presentation\n\nActivities\n\nSpeed Calculator Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nGeometry Calculations Individual Exercise\nAdditional Challenges\n\n"},"Week03/SpeedCalculatorInstructions.html":{"url":"Week03/SpeedCalculatorInstructions.html","title":"Speed Calculator Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Speed Calculator\nIn this exercise, you will need to create a new HTML file from scratch.

You can find a list of common formulas here: http://www.mdc.edu/main/images/common_math_formulas_tcm6-33520.pdf. Choose some cool ones, and create calculators for them. If you're feeling ambitious, you can make up some of your own formulas too! Create at least five formula calculators.\nSome good formulas to try:\n\nVolume of a Sphere\nVolume of a Cone\nDistance between two points\nQuadratic formula\n\nEach page should ask the user for input, perform a calculation, and show the answer. For some of the more involved formulas, you may need to use some of the JavaScript math utilities: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp\nFinally, create one main HTML page that links to each of your calculators.\n"},"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html":{"url":"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html","title":"Additional Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Additional Challenges\nAccomplish all of the challenges below without using if, switch, or any loops.

Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Buttons\nReference\n\nButtons PowerPoint Presentation\n\nActivities\n\nSoundboard Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nSoundboard Individual\nChallenges\n\n"},"Week04/SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.html":{"url":"Week04/SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.html","title":"Soundboard Follow-Along Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Darth Vader \"Sound\" board: Follow-Along\nCreate a new webpage featuring buttons that will say some Darth Vader quotes.\nSoundboard example: https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10715Quotes from here: https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-Darth-Vader-quotes\nSetup\nStart by creating the .html and .js files, and adding the basic tags to them.\n\nCreate a new file called DarthVaderQuotes.html\nIn the DarthVaderQuotes.html file, add the html, head, style, and body elements\nCreate another new file in the same folder called DarthVaderQuotes.js\nIn the HTML file, within the head element, create a script element that points to DarthVaderQuotes.js using the src attribute\n\nDarthVaderQuotes.html\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nBasic Elements\nAdd some basic elements to the webpage, and update a couple styles.\n\nIn the HTML file, in the body element, add an h1 header that says \"Darth Vader Soundboard\"\nBeneath the h1, add a p paragraph\nWithin the p, add an img with its src attribute set to \"https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Darth-Vader_6bda9114.jpeg\"\nIn the style tag, set the background color to black and the text color to red\n\nDarthVaderQuotes.html\n\n    \n        \n            body {\n                background: black;\n                color: red;\n            }\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Darth Vader Soundboard\n        \n    \n\n\nButton With Quote\nAdd a button which will display a Darth Vader quote when clicked.\n\nIn the HTML file, under the p in the body, add a button element that says \"Technological Terror\"\nIn the JS file, define a function called technologicalTerror\nIn the body of the technologicalTerror function, add an alert statement that says \"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.

While this works, the user experience is less than ideal. A better way to communicate with users is through the HTML itself, by using DOM Manipulation. Using DOM manipulation is the next step toward creating a truly dynamic web experience.\nAfter reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to read from existing HTML elements.\nBefore that, though, let's start with some background information.\nBackground\nWhat is the DOM?\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. For more information, check out this article from Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nRepresenting HTML Elements in JavaScript\nSo far, we have stored a few different things in JavaScript variables: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. These are known as Data Types. To store something bigger, like a whole HTML input element, we need to use another data type: Object. Objects in JavaScript can store pretty much anything! For now, we are going to use them to store HTML elements that exist in our HTML document.\nImplementation\nNow, let's cover how we will actually use these concepts to make our webpages more interactive!\nStoring an HTML element in a JavaScript variable\nTo find an element within our HTML page and store it in a variable, we use document.querySelector. This allows us to select an HTML element in the same way we would select it to style it in CSS.

After reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to:\n\nUpdate existing HTML elements\nCreate new HTML elements\nAdd new HTML elements to your webpage\n\nGetting and setting paragraph text\nIt is possible to read from existing paragraphs, on the HTML page, and update their text as well. Check out the following example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        This is a paragraph\n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML paragraph element, and store it in the myTextVariable variable. Once we have our  element stored in the variable, we can use .textContent to get and set its text like so:\nGetting the  text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\nvar myTextValue = myTextVariable.textContent;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myText paragraph\nalert(myTextValue);\n\nSetting the  text\nvar myTextVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myText\");\n\n// update the contents of the #myText paragraph\nmyTextVariable.textContent = \"Different\";\n\nCreating an HTML element with JavaScript\nIn addition to interacting with elements that already exist on the webpage, we can create totally new HTML elements and insert them wherever we want! To create an element, we use document.createElement in JavaScript. This spins up a whole new element, and we can store that element in a variable, like so:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: p. This means that we are creating a  element. If we wanted to create a different type of element, we could pass in the name of a different tag, like a or h1. With a p element, we can also set its text content using .textContent:\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"This is a new paragraph!\";\n\nNow that we have a new HTML element created, we have to insert it into our HTML page. To do this, we use .appendChild on an existing HTML element on the page. Here's an example:\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\n// store the  element in a variable\nvar containerDiv = document.querySelector(\"#container\");\n\n// create a new  element\nvar myParagraph = document.createElement(\"p\");\n\n// give text to the new  element\nmyParagraph.textContent = \"Paragraph Text\";\n\n// insert the new  element into the \ncontainerDiv.appendChild(myParagraph);\n\nWhen the JavaScript code above is executed, the  element will have a new child  element saying \"Paragraph Text\". It will look like this:\n\n    \n        \n            Paragraph Text\n        \n    \n\n\nNow we know how to read from HTML elements and create new ones!\n"},"Week07/LyricsBuilderFollowAlongInstructions.html":{"url":"Week07/LyricsBuilderFollowAlongInstructions.html","title":"Lyrics Builder Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Lyrics Builder\nWe want to create a webpage that will allow us to enter lyrics into a text box line-by-line, and then display them in a nice container.

We will need the lyrics container , and the text :\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nStyling the Lyrics box\nCurrently, the  that will contain the lyrics doesn't have any content, so it won't show up on our page. We want to add a border, a height, a width, and some padding to the box. This  already has an id attribute, so we can use that to select it in CSS in the  tag (#lyricsContainer):\n\n    \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nAdding Interactivity with JavaScript\nNow that we have our HTML all set up, the only thing left to do is make it work! We can start by creating a new JavaScript file called \"LyricsBuilder.js\". Then, we can link the file to our HTML page in a  tag:\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nButton Function\nOnce we have a linked JavaScript file, we can use it to define a function that will execute when the user clicks our \"Add\" button. We will name our function addLine:\nJavaScript File\nfunction addLine() {\n\n}\n\nHTML File\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nNow when the user clicks the \"Add\" button on our HTML page, the code within the addLine function will run!\nGetting text from the \nWhenever the user clicks \"Add\", we want to look at the text within the lineText input. First, we need to use document.querySelector to find the  element and store it in a variable:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n}\n\nNotice the selector we are using here: \"#lineText\". After we have the  element stored in a variable, we want to use .value to retrieve the text that has been entered into the field:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n}\n\nNow, the text the user entered will be stored in the lineText variable!\nCreating the new  element\nNow that we have the text, we can create a new paragraph and place the text in it. To create a new element and store it in a variable, we will use document.createElement:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n}\n\nNext, we want to set the text of this new paragraph (stored in the nextLine variable) to the value of our lineText variable, using .textContent:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n}\n\nNow we have a brand new paragraph!\nInserting the new  element into the \nWe have created a new paragraph, but it still won't appear on our webpage until we insert it somewhere. We want to place it in the lyrics box, our lyricsContainer div. The first thing we need to do is find that  element and store it in a variable:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n}\n\nNotice the selector we are using here: \"#lyricsContainer\". Now that we have our  element stored in the lyricsContainer variable, we can insert the paragraph into it! To do that, we use .appendChild:\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n}\n\nNow, when we click our button, it should create a new paragraph and add it to the lyrics container!\nClearing the Input\nThe last thing we need to do is clear out the value of our  after a line has been added. To accomplish this, we simply set .value of the  to the empty string (\"\"):\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\n    lineTextInput.value = \"\";\n}\n\nNow our Lyrics Builder is fully functional!\nFinal Product\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n        \n            #lyricsContainer {\n                border: 1px dotted black;\n                height: 500px;\n                width: 500px;\n                padding: 10px;\n            }\n        \n    \n    \n        Lyrics\n        \n        Add Line\n        \n            \n            Add\n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript (LyricsBuilder.js)\nfunction addLine() {\n    var lineTextInput = document.querySelector(\"#lineText\");\n    var lineText = lineTextInput.value;\n    var nextLine = document.createElement(\"p\");\n    nextLine.textContent = lineText;\n\n    var lyricsContainer = document.querySelector(\"#lyricsContainer\");\n    lyricsContainer.appendChild(nextLine);\n\n    lineTextInput.value = \"\";\n}\n\n"},"Week07/BackgroundChangerIndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week07/BackgroundChangerIndividualInstructions.html","title":"Background Changer Individual Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Background Changer Revisited\nPreviously, we created a webpage that could change its background color on a button click.

Our task is to add buttons so that we can roll other types of dice as well!\nBackground information - Random Number generation\nRandom numbers can be an extremely useful tool when creating games. Any time there is any sort of probability in a game, it's probably using random numbers!\nMath.random\nIn Javascript, you can use Math.random() to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.\nExpanding the range\nTo make the Math.random() number a little more usable, we first multiply it by however many options we'd like. For example, Math.random()*5 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 5, Math.random()*100 would give you a random decimal number between 0 and 100, and so on. A regular die has 6 sides, so we want to multiply the number by 6.\nLimiting the numbers to integers with Math.floor\nIn our case, we want to generate integers. A die has a certain number of integer sides, so decimals do not really make sense. To round down a decimal number, we use Math.floor(), which will round any decimal number DOWN to the nearest whole number. For example, given 0.01, it would return 0. Given 11.9, it would return 11. Given 5.0, it would return 5, because 5 is already a whole number. After rounding down, it is necessary to add 1.\nWhen applied to our randomly-generated number from a given range, we can get all the sides for a die! Now, let's make some updates to our code to make good use of these random numbers.\nA 4-sided Die Roll\nStart by creating another button, labeled \"D4\", next to the \"D6\" button. As with any button that should execute JavaScript, we want to set its onclick attribute. We are also going to define a new function in the DiceRoller.js file. Use the rollD6 function as a template, because the rollD4 function will be very similar.\nHTML\nD4\n\nJS\nfunction rollD4() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 4;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nA D8 roll\nLet's add another button/function for an 8-sided die. This time, we can simply copy and paste the code for D4. We only have to change a few  things: the function name, the factor multiplied by randomDecimal, and of course, the button text.\nHTML\nD8\n\nJS\nfunction rollD8() {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * 8;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nYou may notice that this is becoming a little tedious. If we needed to do this for many other types of dice, our code would start to become pretty difficult to manage. Luckily, there is a better way: function parameters!\nFunction Parameters\nSince there is only one small part of the functions that differ for different dice rolls, we can use a single function and a parameter instead! This allows us to cut down on repeated code, and makes it easier for us to change the mechanics for all dice rolls.\nUpdating the function definition\nTo add a parameter, we need to place a new variable name within the parenthesis of the function definition, like this:\nfunction rollD8(sides)\n\nAfter that, we can use the sides variable inside of the body of our function. The value of the sides variable will be whatever is passed when the function is called. Replace the 8 in the function body with sides. We should also change the name of this function to reflect that it can handle any number of sides. Change it to simply rollD:\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n    alert(\"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\");\n}\n\nUpdating the function call\nNow that we've updated our function definition, we need to fix how it is called. In the HTML file, update the onclick attribute for the D8 button so that it calls the correct function, and passes in the correct parameter:\nD8\n\nUpdating the function calls for the other dice\nThe big benefit of these parameters is that we can update our other function calls too! Update the onclick for both the D6 and D4 buttons to call the new rollD function. After doing that, we can even remove the additional functions from our JavaScript file, so we only have rollD.\nD6\nD4\nD8\n\nAdding D20\nIt is now incredibly easy to add a new die. We can simply create a new button, and call the rollD function with the appropriate parameter. Add a D20 button to the page too:\nD20\n\nNotice that we don't have to update anything in our JavaScript file; the parameter makes our code flexible enough to work with new values.\nUsing DOM Manipulation to display the dice roll\nWe want to update our function so that instead of using alert to show the roll result to the user, it updates the text of a paragraph on the HTML page. If we had multiple functions for each die, we would have to update all of those functions individually. Lucky for us, we only need to update one function!\nFollow these steps to update the webpage:\n\nIn the HTML, create a new p element under the buttons\nGive the p a unique id attribute\n\n\nIn the JavaScript, remove the alert from the rollD function\nUse document.querySelector to store the p element in a JavaScript variable\nSet the text of the p element to the message using .textContent\n\nHTML\n\n\nJavaScript\nvar paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\nparagraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n\nNow, when the user clicks any of the dice roll buttons, the code should update the p text on the page!\nAdding D120\nAgain, it is incredibly easy to add an additional button. All we have to do is add a new button in the HTML that calls the rollD function with 120 as the parameter value! You can do this with a die having any number of sides.\nFinal Result\nHTML\n\n    \n        \n            body {\n                background-color: red;\n                text-align: center;\n            }\n\n            h1 {\n                color: black;\n            }\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    Dice\n        D6\n        D4\n        D8\n        D20\n        D120\n        \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nfunction rollD(sides) {\n    var randomDecimal = Math.random();\n    var randomDecimalRange = randomDecimal * sides;\n    var randomDiceRoll = Math.floor(randomDecimalRange)+1;\n\n    var paragraphElement = document.querySelector(\"#myParagraph\");\n    paragraphElement.textContent = \"You rolled a \" + randomDiceRoll + \"!\";\n}\n\n"},"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Week08/IndividualInstructions.html","title":"Individual Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Individual Exercise - Background Images\nFollow the instructions below to create a webpage that allows the user to change the background image dynamically. By the end, the user should be able to click buttons to change the background, and enter their own backgrounds image URLs too! Use previous HTML and JavaScript files as references.\nJavaScript code to update the background image\nLater on in this exercise, you will need to update the background image of the page using JavaScript. Here is how you can do that (Replace  with the URL of the image):\ndocument.body.style.background = \"url()\";\n\nRefer back to this code when you need it.\nSetup\n\nCreate a new HTML file\nIn the HTML file, add the basic tags: html, head, style, body\nCreate a new JavaScript file\nIn the HTML file, use a  tag to link the JavaScript file\n\nOnce you complete this setup, complete each of the exercises below in the HTML file and JavaScript file.\nBackground Image\nIn the style tag, use the following CSS to give the page a background image:\nbody {\n    background: url(https://i.imgur.com/cOxUQHY.jpg);\n}\n\nThis is the ruleset we will update with JavaScript when our buttons are clicked.\nOne Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named changeBackground\nRemember, to define a function, you need: function, the name of the function, parentheses, and curly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the changeBackground function (between { and }), insert the code to update the background image to this one: https://i.imgur.com/MdvJ4C2.jpg\nIn the HTML file, add a button to the body of the page with the text \"Image 1\"\nAdd in code so that when the \"Image 1\" button is clicked, the changeBackground function is called, and the background changes\n\nTwo Buttons\nRepeat the steps above to create ANOTHER button AND function that will change the background to this image: https://i.imgur.com/yfQ8Uj4.jpg\nThe function name and button text should be different. Name the function changeBackground2 and give the button the text \"Image 2\".\nParameter Time\nNow, your JavaScript file should contain two very similar functions. The only differences are the names of the functions, and the actual URLs for the images. Looks like a parameter could help us simplify our code!\nUpdating the function definition\n\nIn the changeBackground function, replace the actual URL in the string with a new variable named backgroundUrl\nTo do this, you will have to add together three values\n\n\nInstead of declaring backgroundUrl as a variable, make it a parameter by placing it within the parentheses of the function definiton\n\nUpdating the function calls\n\nIn the HTML file, update the call to changeBackground so that it passes in the original URL as the parameter\nBecause this call is within double quotes, surround the url with single quotes inside of the parentheses\n\n\nUpdate the \"Image 2\" button to call the changeBackground function on click as well, passing in its own URL\n\nNow we can get rid of our changeBackground2 function, and everything should still work!\nThree Buttons\nIn the HTML, add a third button. This button should again call the changeBackground function, but it should pass in a new URL: https://i.imgur.com/r9ywXwx.jpg. The button text should be \"Image 3\". Notice that we can add this button without making any changes to the JavaScript!\n(BONUS) Prompt for Image\nAdd another button to the page that, when clicked, will ask the user for a URL, and set the background image to whatever they enter.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called promptForBg\nIn the body of the promptForBg function, use a prompt to ask the user what they want the background to be\nMake sure to store their response in a variable\n\n\nUnder that prompt, call the changeBackground function and pass in the value the user entered\nIn the HTML file, create a new button with the text \"Prompt for Bg\" that should call the promptForBg function when clicked\nNote that we do not have to pass in a URL to the promptForBg function - the function will get the URL from the user\n\n\n\nThis is a good example of reusing code to implement new features. By calling the changeBackground function, we were able to avoid unnecessary code duplication!\n(BONUS) Input for Image\nFinally, we want to create an HTML input and a button that will set the background image to whatever URL the user has entered in the input when clicked.\n\nIn the HTML file, create a new div element\nInside the new div element, create a new text input and a new button\nThe input should have an id of \"bgInput\"\nThe button should say \"Input for Bg\"\n\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function called inputForBg\nIn the body of the inputForBg function, select the input element from the HTML, and store it in a variable named bgInputElement\nDeclare another variable named bgInputValue, and set its value to the value of the bgInputElement\nCall the changeBackground function and pass in the bgInputValue variable\nSet the value of the bgInputElement to be empty\nIn the HTML file, make \"Input for Bg\" button call the inputForBg function when clicked\n\nThat's it! Now you should be able to easily set the background of your webpage to any image you like.\n"},"Week08/Challenge.html":{"url":"Week08/Challenge.html","title":"Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Challenge - Various Functions\nCreate a webpage where users can perform various functions on two inputs.\nSetup\nBasics\n\nCreate a new HTML file and JavaScript file with all the basic boiler-plate starter code\nIn the HTML file:\nCreate two text inputs, each with an id\nCreate a paragraph with an id\nCreate a button with the text \"Add\"\n\n\n\nFirst Button\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named addNumbers\nThe addNumbers function should:\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nConvert the text values into numbers\nAdd the two numbers together\nRetrieve the paragraph from the HTML\nSet the paragraph's text to be the result of the calculation\nClear the text input values\n\n\nIn the HTML file, set the onclick attribute of the button to call the addNumbers function\n\nSecond Button\nRepeat the steps above for a new function: multiplyNumbers. Add a new button to the HTML, and test out both of your buttons.\nAbstracting the Functionality\nSo far, we are able to execute two functions on the two input values. We want to expand this to make it easier to add more functions, without repeating a lot of code.\nSimplifying functions\nOur addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions are doing too much right now. In general, functions should do as little as possible, so we don't have to repeat code.\nSimplify the addNumbers and multiplyNumbers functions. They should:\n\nTake in the text values as parameters\nConvert the values to numbers\nPerform the calculation\nReturn the result of the calculation (see below)\n\n// assuming the result of the calculation is stored in calcResult\nreturn calcResult;\n\nRunner function\nThe next step is to create a runner function that will call all other functions as needed. Each button should be identifiable by a number. The runner function will call the corresponding function.\n\nIn the JavaScript file, define a function named runButton\nThe runButton function should:\nTake in a numeric parameter representing which function to call\nRetrieve the text values from the two text inputs in the HTML\nCall the appropriate function, passing the text values as parameters\nE.g., if the numeric parameter is 1, add. If the numeric parameter is 2, multiply.\n\n\nSet the paragraph's text to the result of the function call\nClear the text input values\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say the \"Add\" button is 1, and the \"Multiply\" button is 2. Calling runButton(1) should perform the addNumbers action, and calling runButton(2) should perform the multiplyNumbers. Note that these identifiers are completely arbitrary. You could use any sort of parameter, as long as the runButton calls the right function!\nUpdating function calls\nNow, our runButton function should be able to handle any of our buttons! Update the onclick attribute for each button so that it calls runButton with the appropriate numeric identifier.\nAdding new buttons\nNow, to add a new button and function, take these steps:\n\nIn the JavaScript, define a new function that will take in two values, and return the result\nCall this function within the runButton function based on its numeric identifier (e.g., 3)\nIn the HTML, create a new button that will call runButton with the numeric identifier as the parameter (e.g., 3)\n\nThat's all! Next, add buttons that will perform the following actions:\n\nDivide the two inputs\nSay whether or not the two inputs are equal (return a string)\nReturn the larger input\nReturn the average of the two inputs\nReturn the larger input minus the smaller input\n\nMore functions - Single input\nTry to think of possible calculations to perform on a single input.
