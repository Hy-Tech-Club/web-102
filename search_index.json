For this challenge, assume the user will enter their first name, then a space, then their last name.\nExample\nInstead of displaying \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\", display \"First Name: Charlie\" and \"Last Name: Chaplin\" on separate lines.\nDisplay actual date\nInstead of displaying the date the user enters, display the actual date.\nOK/Cancel\nAfter the last question, display a pop-up box that has both \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" options. The text in the box should say \"Continue?\".\n\nIf the user clicks OK, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: true\"\nIf the user clicks Cancel, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: false\"\n\nRegardless of what the user chooses to do, continue on and display their information.\nHalf-birthday\nAsk the user for their date of birth, then display their half birthday based on what they enter.\n\nAssume the user will enter their information in the form of \"MM/DD\"\nWhen displaying their half birthday, only show the month and day, in the form \"MM/DD\"\nDo not worry about leap years\n\nDays until the New Year\nIn addition to displaying today's date, display the number of days until the New Year. For example, if today were 12/31, it should display \"1\". If today were 3/9, it should display \"298\".\nTemplate literals\n\nResource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\n\nFigure out how to use template literals to display multi-line text and include variable values without using + or \\n!\n"},"Week03/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week03/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 3 - Comments, Data Types, and Math","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Comments, Data Types, and Math\nReference\n\nMore Concepts PowerPoint Presentation\n\nActivities\n\nSpeed Calculator Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nGeometry Calculations Individual Exercise\nAdditional Challenges\n\n"},"Week03/SpeedCalculatorInstructions.html":{"url":"Week03/SpeedCalculatorInstructions.html","title":"Speed Calculator Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Speed Calculator\nIn this exercise, you will need to create a new HTML file from scratch.

Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"},"Week04/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Week04/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Web 102: Buttons\nReference\n\nButtons PowerPoint Presentation\n\nActivities\n\nSoundboard Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nSoundboard Individual\nChallenges\n\n"},"Week04/SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.html":{"url":"Week04/SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.html","title":"Soundboard Follow-Along Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Darth Vader \"Sound\" board: Follow-Along\nCreate a new webpage featuring buttons that will say some Darth Vader quotes.\nSoundboard example: https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10715Quotes from here: https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-Darth-Vader-quotes\nSetup\nStart by creating the .html and .js files, and adding the basic tags to them.\n\nCreate a new file called DarthVaderQuotes.html\nIn the DarthVaderQuotes.html file, add the html, head, style, and body elements\nCreate another new file in the same folder called DarthVaderQuotes.js\nIn the HTML file, within the head element, create a script element that points to DarthVaderQuotes.js using the src attribute\n\nDarthVaderQuotes.html\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nBasic Elements\nAdd some basic elements to the webpage, and update a couple styles.\n\nIn the HTML file, in the body element, add an h1 header that says \"Darth Vader Soundboard\"\nBeneath the h1, add a p paragraph\nWithin the p, add an img with its src attribute set to \"https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Darth-Vader_6bda9114.jpeg\"\nIn the style tag, set the background color to black and the text color to red\n\nDarthVaderQuotes.html\n\n    \n        \n            body {\n                background: black;\n                color: red;\n            }\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Darth Vader Soundboard\n        \n    \n\n\nButton With Quote\nAdd a button which will display a Darth Vader quote when clicked.\n\nIn the HTML file, under the p in the body, add a button element that says \"Technological Terror\"\nIn the JS file, define a function called technologicalTerror\nIn the body of the technologicalTerror function, add an alert statement that says \"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.

While this works, the user experience is less than ideal. A better way to communicate with users is through the HTML itself, by using DOM Manipulation. Using DOM manipulation is the next step toward creating a truly dynamic web experience.\nAfter reading through this guide, you should be able to use JavaScript to read from existing HTML elements.\nBefore that, though, let's start with some background information.\nBackground\nWhat is the DOM?\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. For more information, check out this article from Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nRepresenting HTML Elements in JavaScript\nSo far, we have stored a few different things in JavaScript variables: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. These are known as Data Types. To store something bigger, like a whole HTML input element, we need to use another data type: Object. Objects in JavaScript can store pretty much anything! For now, we are going to use them to store HTML elements that exist in our HTML document.\nImplementation\nNow, let's cover how we will actually use these concepts to make our webpages more interactive!\nStoring an HTML element in a JavaScript variable\nTo find an element within our HTML page and store it in a variable, we use document.querySelector. This allows us to select an HTML element in the same way we would select it to style it in CSS. Note that here, we are storing the ACTUAL HTML ELEMENT, not just the text!\nHTML\n\n    \n        Input your message: \n    \n\n\nJavaScript\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\n\n\nNotice the text between the quotes in the JS: #myInput. This is exactly what we would use in CSS to select and style the input with an id of \"myInput\".\n\nHere, our document.querySelector code allows us to grab that whole HTML input element, and store it in the myMessageVariable variable. Once we have our HTML element stored in the variable, we can interact with it! We can use .value to get and set the text entered in the  tag like so:\nGetting the  value\nvar myMessageVariable = document.querySelector(\"#myInput\");\nvar myMessageValue = myMessageVariable.value;\n\n// show a message with the contents of the #myInput input\nalert(\"Your message was: \" + myMessageValue);\n\n"},"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html":{"url":"Week06/MadLibsFollowAlong.html","title":"Mad Libs Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Mad Libs Follow-Along\nCreate a webpage that will allow the user to enter some individual words and tell a silly story.\n\nBasic Setup\n\nCreate a new HTML file called MadLibs.html\nAdd the basic tags: html, head, body\nCreate a new JavaScript file called MadLibs.js\nLink the JavaScript file in the HTML file using a script tag\n\nCreating the inputs in HTML\n\nIn the HTML file, create an appropriate header for the webpage saying \"Pizza Pizza\"\nCreate a p paragraph element containing a text label and a textbox input for \"Adjective\"\nEnsure that the input element has an id attribute\n\n\nCreate additional p elements containing labels and inputs for \"Nationality\" and \"Person\"\n\nMadLibs.html\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Pizza Pizza\n        Adjective: \n        Nationality: \n        Person: \n    \n\n\nDefining the function in JavaScript\nIn the JavaScript file, define a new function named madLibs:\n\nfunction keyword\nfunction name (madLibs)\nparentheses (())\ncurly brackets ({})\n\nMadLibs.js\nfunction madLibs() {\n\n}\n\nGetting the values from inputs\nIn the body of the madLibs function:\n\nStore the\"Adjective\" input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1El =)\ndocument.querySelector()\nquotes (\"\")\nselector for the first input (#adj)\n\n\nStore the text from the input element in a variable\nnew variable (var adj1Val =)\nelement variable (adj1El)\n.value\n\n\nRepeat the above steps for each of the three inputs\n\nMadLibs.js\nvar adj1El = document.querySelector(\"#adj1\");\nvar adj1Val = adj1El.value;\n\nvar nationalityEl = document.querySelector(\"#nationality\");\nvar nationalityVal = nationalityEl.value;\n\nvar personEl = document.querySelector(\"#person\");\nvar personVal = personEl.value;\n\nDisplaying the story\nCreate an alert and put the story together.
