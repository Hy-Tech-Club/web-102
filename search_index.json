Store all of the user's answers in their own variables. Make sure you choose good variable names!\n\nWhat is your full name?\nWhat is your favorite color?\nWhat is your favorite movie?\nWhat is the date today?\n\nPart 3 - Displaying answers\nFor each of the answers retrieved in the previous part, show the user a formatted message like \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\". For an added challenge, attempt to display all the information in only one message box. Use \\n to add a new line into the text value.\nChallenges\nFor these challenges, do some research on your own and try to figure out how to solve them.

For this challenge, assume the user will enter their first name, then a space, then their last name.\nExample\nInstead of displaying \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\", display \"First Name: Charlie\" and \"Last Name: Chaplin\" on separate lines.\nDisplay actual date\nInstead of displaying the date the user enters, display the actual date.\nOK/Cancel\nAfter the last question, display a pop-up box that has both \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" options. The text in the box should say \"Continue?\".\n\nIf the user clicks OK, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: true\"\nIf the user clicks Cancel, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: false\"\n\nRegardless of what the user chooses to do, continue on and display their information.\nHalf-birthday\nAsk the user for their date of birth, then display their half birthday based on what they enter.\n\nAssume the user will enter their information in the form of \"MM/DD\"\nWhen displaying their half birthday, only show the month and day, in the form \"MM/DD\"\nDo not worry about leap years\n\nDays until the New Year\nIn addition to displaying today's date, display the number of days until the New Year. For example, if today were 12/31, it should display \"1\".

If you're feeling ambitious, you can make up some of your own formulas too! Create at least five formula calculators.\nSome good formulas to try:\n\nVolume of a Sphere\nVolume of a Cone\nDistance between two points\nQuadratic formula\n\nEach page should ask the user for input, perform a calculation, and show the answer. For some of the more involved formulas, you may need to use some of the JavaScript math utilities: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp\nFinally, create one main HTML page that links to each of your calculators.\n"},"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html":{"url":"Week03/AdditionalChallenges.html","title":"Additional Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Additional Challenges\nAccomplish all of the challenges below without using if, switch, or any loops. Make sure to check the resource links if you're stuck!\nResources:\n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp\nhttps://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions\n\nRepeater\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will repeat a message. Ask the user to enter a message, and then ask them how many times they would like to repeat it. Display the output.\nDice Roll\nCreate a new HTML page that, when opened, will display a message with a random number from 1-6.\nMany-sided die\nBefore displaying the random number, ask the user how many choices should be available for the dice roll. There should be no limit to the number of sides on the die. For example, if the user says \"12\", the program should display a random number from 1-12.\nVisual die\nCreate another new HTML page where, instead of simply displaying the number, it displays a visual representation of the die. For example, a roll of 2 would display \"X X \", a roll of 5 would display \"X X X X X \", and so on.\nRandom Password\nCreate a new HTML page that will generate a numeric random password for the user. First, ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-16). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only numeric characters.\nNon-numeric password\nCreate another HTML page that will generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. Ask the user how many characters they would like for the password (1-8). Then, generate the password for them! The password should consist of only lowercase letters.\nDivision with Quotient and Remainder\nCreate another HTML page that will calculate the quotient AND remainder for two numbers. Ask the user to enter the two numbers (the dividend and divisor) and then display the quotient and remainder. For example, if the user enters \"15\" for the dividend, and \"7\" for the divisor, the program should output \"7 R 1\". You can use this tool to test your math: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php\nMultiply by 2\nCreate another HTML page that will multiply a given number by 2, with one catch: do not use +, -, /, or *. Ask the user for a number to multiply, and then perform the calculation. For example, if the user enters \"6\", the program should display \"12\".\nMultiply by a power of 2\nInstead of multiplying by 2 every time, ask the user for a power of 2 to multiply by. For example, if the user enters \"5\" for the number, and \"2\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 5 times (2^2), which reduces to 5 times 4, and display \"20\". In this example, the ^ symbol represents an exponent. If the user enters \"9\" for the number and \"9\" for the power of 2, the program should perform the calculation 9 times (2^9) and display \"4608\".\nRegular Expressions\nLearn about regular expressions with this tutorial: https://regexone.com/\nThen, create another HTML page that will test a string against a regular expression. For example, if the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"true\". If the user entered \"Hello\" for the string, and \"ello2\" for the regular expression, the program should display \"false\".\n"}}}
