Then, follow the instructions below to build a little text-based JavaScript program. The program will ask the user a number of questions, and then display some information using the answers the user provides.\nPart 1 - Setup\n\nAdd the html tag to your page\nAdd the head tag to your page (child of html)\nAdd the script tag to your page (child of head)\nWithin the script, add a statement that will show a message to the user welcoming them to your website.\n\nnote: a body is not required for this HTML page\nPart 2 - Asking questions\nFor each of the questions below, show a text box to the user allowing them to answer. Store all of the user's answers in their own variables. Make sure you choose good variable names!\n\nWhat is your full name?\nWhat is your favorite color?\nWhat is your favorite movie?\nWhat is the date today?\n\nPart 3 - Displaying answers\nFor each of the answers retrieved in the previous part, show the user a formatted message like \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\". For an added challenge, attempt to display all the information in only one message box. Use \\n to add a new line into the text value.\nChallenges\nFor these challenges, do some research on your own and try to figure out how to solve them. Please feel free to hop around from one challenge to another, they are not listed in order of difficulty. You should also be able to complete all of these challenges without using if statements, switch statements, for loops, or while loops (which are more advanced topics).\nThese may be helpful resources:\n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp\n\nUppercase movie\nNo matter what the user enters, display their favorite movie in all in uppercase letters.\nRemoving whitespace from movie\nRemove all spaces from the beginning and end of the text the user enters for their favorite movie.\nReplacing red\nIf the user enters \"red\" as their favorite color, replace it with \"blue\" instead.\nSeparate First and Last name\nInstead of displaying the user's full name in one line, display their first name and last name separately. For this challenge, assume the user will enter their first name, then a space, then their last name.\nExample\nInstead of displaying \"Name: Charlie Chaplin\", display \"First Name: Charlie\" and \"Last Name: Chaplin\" on separate lines.\nDisplay actual date\nInstead of displaying the date the user enters, display the actual date.\nOK/Cancel\nAfter the last question, display a pop-up box that has both \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" options. The text in the box should say \"Continue?\".\n\nIf the user clicks OK, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: true\"\nIf the user clicks Cancel, display a message saying \"You chose to continue: false\"\n\nRegardless of what the user chooses to do, continue on and display their information.\nHalf-birthday\nAsk the user for their date of birth, then display their half birthday based on what they enter.\n\nAssume the user will enter their information in the form of \"MM/DD\"\nWhen displaying their half birthday, only show the month and day, in the form \"MM/DD\"\nDo not worry about leap years\n\nDays until the New Year\nIn addition to displaying today's date, display the number of days until the New Year. For example, if today were 12/31, it should display \"1\". If today were 3/9, it should display \"298\".\nTemplate literals\n\nResource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\n\nFigure out how to use template literals to display multi-line text and include variable values without using + or \\n!\n"}}}
