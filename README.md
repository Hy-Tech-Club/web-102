## 11-Week Virtual Semester
For an 11-week semester, skip the content for Week 9 and move Week 10's content down instead. After that, the students should begin working on their final projects. They can present their projects Week 11. Additionally, use [repl.it](https://repl.it) instead of VS Code for a virtual semester.
