# Darth Vader "Sound" board: Individual Exercises
Update the soundboard with some additional quotes and buttons!

###### Resource: Making Buttons
Remember, the steps to add a button for a quote are as follows:
1. Create a new `button` element in the HTML file, and give it text to display
1. _Define_ a new **function** in the JS file
    - To _define_ a function, use the `function` keyword, a function name, and curly brackets
1. Within the body of the **function**, use an `alert` to display the quote in a message
1. Back in the HTML file, set the `onclick` attribute of the button so that it _calls_ the function
    - To _call_ a function, use the function name and open/close parentheses
1. Open your webpage in the browser to test the button!

## More Quotes
Add new buttons for each of the following quotes:

1. "He will join us or die, Master."
1. "There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. Luke, you do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
1. "No, I am your father."

### Bonus: Dark Helmet Quotes
1. "I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate."
1. "Jammed? Raspberry. There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry! Lone Starr!"

## `{yourName}, I am your father`
Update the "No, I am your father" function so that it asks the user for their name, and says they are the user's father.

1. In the body of the function that says "No, I am your father," add a `prompt` asking the user for their name
    - Remember to store their answer in a variable!
1. Update the `alert` so that instead of saying "No," it says the user's name
    - For example, if the user entered "Luke" as their name, it should say "Luke, I am your father."

## New Character
Instead of Darth Vader, update your "sound" board so that it features a different character! Change the image and the quotes.
